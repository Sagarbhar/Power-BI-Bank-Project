# BANK-Dashboard


## Problem Statement

The TechnoEdge Customers Banking Details dataset contains information on customers' banking details, including their customer ID, name, surname, gender, age, country, state, job classification, marital status, account type, date joined, balance, house loan, and other loan details. The dataset appears to be focused on the banking and financial activities of TechnoEdge customers.

## Objectives

1) Analyze the age distribution of TechnoEdge banking customers and identify the most common age group.

2) Compare the average balance in the accounts of male and female customers to determine if there is a gender-based disparity in account balances.

3) Identify the top three states with the highest number of TechnoEdge banking customers and determine the percentage of total customers they constitute.

4) Analyze the correlation between the type of job classification and the presence of housing and other loans among TechnoEdge banking customers.

5) Determine the percentage of married customers with housing loans and compare it to the percentage of unmarried customers with housing loans to identify any significant differences.

6) Identify the most common account type among TechnoEdge banking customers and determine the percentage of total customers with this account type.

7) Analyze the relationship between the length of time a customer has been with TechnoEdge and their account balance to determine if there is a correlation between the two variables.

8) Identify the top three countries with the highest number of TechnoEdge banking customers and determine the percentage of total customers they constitute.



### Data Cleaning

1) Used the "Change Type" option in Power Query to alter data types for each column.

2) Used the "Transform Data" tab and the "Capitalize Each Word" option to display the "Name" column in capitalized format for each word.

3) Used the "Add Column" tab and the "Merge Columns" option to combine the "Name" and "SurName" columns using a space separator.

4) Used the "Transform Data" tab and the "Remove Rows" option to select the "Remove Blank Rows" option to remove any blank rows from the dataset.

5) Used the "Combine Data" tab and the "Merge Queries" option to join the bank details with the customer details based on the customer ID.

6) Accessed the "Transform Data" tab in Power Query and choose the "Date. Year" function to extract the Day from a date column.

7) Used the "Add Column" tab and the "Round" option to round up the total balance to the nearest whole number.
